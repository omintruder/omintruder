I don't have much idea how to put a bio correctly on the GitHub yet, but still.
My name is Michael, I'm currently an econ major at the HSE-NES Joint Programme with a complete inclination towards mathematics and CS.
I fancy probability theory and machine learning, capable of writing in C++, Python, SQL, LaTeX. I have and will upload here research and utility code I find interesting or applicable.
